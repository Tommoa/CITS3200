# List of proposed projects
There are a number of proposed projects for the unit "CITS3200: Professional Computing". The list below goes in descending order of our top ten preferences, with our reasonings for each listed below each project name.

## Online Competitions for AI Bots [Dr. Tim French]
There are a number of reasons that we believe that our team is a good fit for this project:
 - All of our team members either have done or are currently doing [CITS3001](https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3001), the unit explicitly mentioned by as a use case for the project.
   - This should allow our team to have a better understanding of the requirements for the system.
   - The team also has familiarity with Dr. Tim French (the client) as a result as well, which we believe will lead to a better communication.
 - A member of our team has previously built a usable programming competition server.
   - The apparent similarities of the two problems are very apparent.
     - Both involve taking some unknown code and running it on a machine. This means that we will be aware and know how to manage the security implications of this issue.
	 - Both rely on socket-based interactions to communicate with the foreign program.
	 - Both have a web-server front end for program submission.

## A wechat-based survey tool for Chinese international students [Dr. Yu Tao]

Pros:
 - Our team involves two Chinese international students, which will allow us to have a good grasp of the requirements and problem space.

Cons:
 - Our team is unfamiliar with the process and API for creating Wechat apps

## Web based front end to Google cloud AI services [Mr. Ron Jones]
Pros:
 - Some of our team is familiar with the Google Cloud AI service and API, giving us a good understanding of the problem space.

## UWAHS Campus Walk - with Oral Histories [Dr. Fran Pesich]

Pros:
 - Our team is passionate about the development and history of the university.
 - We are aware of the various APIs that are required to complete the requested application.

Cons:
 - We lack familiarity with the creation of mobile apps.

## Unigames Game Library Management and Borrowing System [Ms. Taylor Home]

Pros:
 - Our team is familiar with the current system in use at Unigames for this purpose. We believe this will allow us to have a better understanding of the problem space and requirements.
 - Our team is aquainted with the client, which we believe will lead to better communication.

## Deformation measurement in Python [Dr. Ghulam Mubashar Hassan]

Pros:
 - Our team is familiar with both Python and MATLAB, which should allow for a relatively smooth transition between the two languages.
 - Some members of our team are currently studying mathematics, which may help the team understand the (already covered) mathematical side of the project.
 - Some members of our team participate in programming competitions, which has lead to a good understanding of how to optimise code and ensure that it is computationally efficient.

## Network Deployment of Cyberforensic Tools [Dr. Richard Adams]

Pros:
 - The majority of our team has either done or are currently doing the units "Networks and Security" and/or "Cybersecurity". This will help lead the team to a better understanding of the requirements of the project.

## Ethological software for fieldwork on Western Australian magpies [Ms. Lizzie Speechley]

## Online tool for oral feedback in foreign language learning [Dr. Nicola Fraschini]

Pros:
 - Our team is familiar with the javascript APIs for recording and saving audio.

## SAGE Accommodation booking System [Ms. April Harris]
